But when Halo is dragged away by fishermen, her wild adventure begins . . . Halo soon realizes that if she is to survive then she must live in disguise - as a boy. A violent war is threatening to erupt and Halo is at the mercy of the mighty Spartan warriors. And as she battles to hide her secret, Halo never forgets her quest to find out who she is - and where she really came from.",

This is a life-or-death mission for ONI's black-ops team, Kilo-Five, which is tasked with preventing the ruthless Elites, once the military leaders of the Covenant, from regrouping and threatening humankind again. What began as a routine dirty-tricks operation?keeping the Elites busy with their own insurrection?turns into a desperate bid to extract one member of Kilo-Five from the seething heart of an alien civil war. But troubles never come singly for Kilo-Five. Colonial terrorism is once again surfacing on one of the worlds that survived the war against the Covenant, and the man behind it is much more than just a name to Spartan-010. Meanwhile, the treasure trove of Forerunner technology recovered from the shield world of Onyx is being put to work while a kidnapped Elite plots vengeance on the humans he fears will bring his people to the brink of destruction.

And then if God wants you, He will call you.’” Young Glen Romani was destined and determined to become a much loved and respected parish priest, like Father Madsen. The thought of it occupied nearly every waking moment as he strove to live a life worthy of this sacred calling. Glen’s love for God and his commitment to the holy Catholic Church were far beyond reproach. But something happened to Glen on his way to the altar...life. His fast-track to the priesthood made an abrupt and unscheduled stop. Sadness, bitter disappointment and resentment took hold of Wednesday’s Child, shattered his rock-solid religious foundation and finally brought him to his knees. Glen lost his faith in God, his family and all of mankind, except for one...Melissa Laurien, the love of his life. See if true love can in fact save the soul of the man who was said to wear a HALO.”",

        "description": "Even if you've finished Halo 2 in Legendary Mode, you're not done with this game. Not by a long shot. You know there's a lot more you can squeeze out of Halo 2, and with the clever hacks we have in store, you'll turn the game into a whole new experience. Halo 2 Hacks is the creation of consummate gamer and Microsoft insider Stephen Cawood, an original member of the Halo 2 beta test team. He's got it all, whether you're into single or multiplayer games, a level 25 or above, or even a complete n00b. If you are a beginner, you may not yet appreciate that Halo 2 for Xbox is the biggest game to hit the galaxy. Ten million copies have already sold, including 2.4 million on the first day it hit the shelf. So you're in good company, even if you've never played its predecessor, Halo: Combat Evolved. Pick up this book and you'll be able to fully appreciate the Halo 2 universe. Halo 2 Hacks is packed with a horde of great hacks for weapons, levels, vehicles, game play and mods. You'll learn how to perform expert tricks, exploit glitches and find Halo 2 Easter Eggs - including the famous skulls. And discover all the nooks and crannies you didn't even suspect were there. Each hack has a thermometer icon to indicate its relative complexity, whether it's a beginner, moderate, or expert hack. Each one stands on its own, so you can either read the book from cover to cover, or jump around until you see a hack you want to try. This title was created with the help of numerous gamers from the Halo community. Whether it was a trick, a glitch or a mod, Cawood went straight to the source and gathered all of the necessary information to help you complete the hack. The mod section of the book features contributions from Grenadiac, MrMurder, Iron_Forge, GTJuggler, The Swamp Fox, and many more. Halo 2 Hacks also features a foreword by Ducain (the admin for HighImpactHalo.org), Louis Wu (the admin for Halo.Bungie.org) and Grenadiac (the admin for HaloMods.com). For all the brave souls who want to learn how to trick Halo 2 into running the hacks and mods of their choice, Halo 2 Hacks is a must read. Roughly half of this title is dedicated to creating your own Halo 2 mods. If you're a fan of tricking, glitching or modding, then this is the book for you. But only for gamers who think they're worthy of the distinction.",

        "description": "Since the Doom series, First Person Shooter (FPS) videogames have ricocheted through the gaming community, often reaching outside that community to the wider public. While critics primarily lampoon FPSs for their aggressiveness and on-screen violence, gamers see something else. Halo is one of the greatest, most successful FPSs ever to grace the world of gaming. Although Halo is a FPS, it has a science-fiction storyline that draws from previous award-winning science fiction literature. It employs a game mechanic that limits the amount of weapons a player can carry to two, and a multiplayer element that has spawned websites like Red vs. Blue and games within the game created by players themselves. Halo’s unique and extraordinary features raise serious questions. Are campers really doing anything wrong? Does Halo’s music match the experience of the gamer? Would Plato have used Halo to train citizens to live an ethical life? What sort of Artificial Intelligence exists in Halo and how is it used? Can the player’s experience of war tell us anything about actual war? Is there meaning to Master Chief’s rough existence? How does it affect the player’s ego if she identifies too strongly with an aggressive character like Master Chief? Is Halo really science fiction? Can Halo be used for enlightenment-oriented thinking in the Buddhist sense? Does Halo's weapon limitation actually contribute to the depth of the gameplay? When we willingly play Halo only to die again and again, are we engaging in some sort of self-injurious behavior? What is expansive gameplay and how can it be informed by the philosophy of Michel Foucault? In what way does Halo’s post-apocalyptic paradigm force gamers to see themselves as agents of divine deliverance? What can Red vs. Blue teach us about personal identity? These questions are tackled by writers who are both Halo cognoscenti and active philosophers, with a foreword by renowned Halo fiction author Fred Van Lente and an afterword by leading games scholar and artist Roger Ngim.",

        "description": "This is how it began . . . It is the year 2524. Harvest is a peaceful, prosperous farming colony on the very edge of human-controlled space. But we have trespassed on holy ground – strayed into the path of an aggressive alien empire known as “The Covenant.” What begins as a chance encounter between an alien privateer and a human freighter catapults mankind into a struggle for its very existence. But humanity is also locked in a bitter civil war known as the “Insurrection.” So the survival of Harvest’s citizens falls to a squad of battle-weary UNSC Marines and their inexperienced colonial militia trainees. In this unlikely group of heroes, one stands above the rest . . . a young Marine staff sergeant named Avery Johnson.",

This is how it began... It is the year 2524. Harvest is a peaceful, prosperous farming colony on the very edge of human-controlled space. But we have trespassed on holy ground--strayed into the path of an aggressive alien empire known as the Covenant. What begins as a chance encounter between an alien privateer and a human freighter catapults mankind into a struggle for its very existence. But humanity is also locked in a bitter civil war known as the Insurrection. So the survival of Harvest's citizens falls to a squad of battle-weary UNSC Marines and their inexperienced colonial militia trainees. In this unlikely group of heroes, one stands above the rest...a young Marine staff sergeant named Avery Johnson.

Internal strife within the ecumene has desperately weakened Forerunner defenses. Too little, too late, the legal rate of Juridicals is only now investigating possible crimes by the Master Builder and others. Evidence-gathering agents known collectively as Catalog have been dispatched to collect testimony from the Librarian and both Didacts: the Ur-Didact, treacherously abandoned in a Flood-infested system, and the Bornstellar Didact, who accompanies the Librarian as she preserves specimens against the dire possibility of Halo extermination. Facing the imminent collapse of their civilization, the Librarian and the Ur-Didact reveal what they know about the relationship between the long-vanished Precursors and the Flood. The Precursors created many technological species, including humanity and the Forerunners. But the roots of the Flood may be found in an act of enormous barbarity, carried out beyond our galaxy ten million years before... Because of that barbarism, a greater evil looms. Only the Ur-Didact and the Librarian--husband and wife pushed into desperate conflict--hold the keys to a solution. Facing the consequences of a mythic tragedy, one of them must now commit the greatest atrocity of all time-to prevent an insane evil from dominating the entire universe ... in Greg Bear's Halo: Silentium.

        "description": "The second in a new series of three HALO novels, Greg Bear's Halo: Primordium dives back into the Forerunner saga. A long time ago, I was a living, breathing human being. I went mad. I served my enemies. They became my only friends. Since then, I've traveled back and forth across this galaxy, and out to the spaces between galaxies--a greater reach than any human before me. You have asked me to tell you about that time. Since you are the last true Reclaimer, I must obey. Are you recording? Good. Because my memory is failing rapidly. I doubt I'll be able to finish the story. Once, on my birth-world, a world I knew as Erde-Tyrene, and which now is called Earth, my name was Chakas... In the wake of apparent self-destruction of the Forerunner empire, two humans--Chakas and Riser--are like flotsam washed up on very strange shores indeed. Captured by the Master Builder, misplaced during a furious battle in space, they now find themselves on an inverted world where horizons rise into the sky, and where humans of all kinds are trapped in a perilous cycle of horror and neglect. For they have become both research animals and strategic pawns in a cosmic game whose madness knows no end--a game of ancient vengeance between the powers who seeded the galaxy with life, and the Forerunners who expect to inherit their sacred Mantle of duty to all living things. In the company of a young girl and an old man, Chakas begins an epic journey across a lost and damaged Halo in search of a way home, an explanation for the warrior spirits rising up within, and for the Librarian's tampering with human destiny. This journey will take them into the Palace of Pain, the domain of a powerful and monstrous intelligence who claims to be the Last Precursor, and who now has control of both this Halo and the fate of Forerunners and Humans alike. Called the Captive by Forerunners, and the Primordial by ancient human warriors, this intelligence has taken charge of, and retasked, the Master Builder's cruel researches into the Flood--which it may have itself unleashed on the galaxy more than ten thousand years before.

With the Covenant War over, the Office of Naval Intelligence faces old grievances rising again to threaten Earth. The angry, bitter colonies, still with scores to settle from the insurrection put on hold for thirty years, now want justice -- and so does a man whose life was torn apart by ONI when his daughter was abducted for the SPARTAN-II program. Black ops squad Kilo-Five find their loyalties tested beyond breaking point when the father of their Spartan comrade, still searching for the truth about her disappearance, prepares to glass Earth's cities to get an answer. How far will Kilo-Five go to stop him? And will he be able to live with the truth when he finds it? The painful answer lies with a man long dead, and a conscience that still survives in the most unlikely, undiscovered place.

It came from the proper source, within proper channels, encoded with the latest series of ciphers. Everything seemed in order. It was not. The mission was a one-way ticket to oblivion and the ambush MESA walked into took every life of the team. All except one. Yup, you guessed it. David Lockhart managed to shoot his way out, a combination of skills, training, and a beautiful woman. For the perpetrators of this betrayal of one of the most successful covert teams in American history, David Lockhart's survival was not a good thing. No, it was not a good thing. For now Lockhart was mad. Not the raging, red-faced, out-of-control, irrational type of mad. You see, David Lockhart wasn't like that. His anger was far more dangerous, for his outlet was directed at planning, cold and calculating analysis of what went wrong. Just be certain that revenge would be his.",

        "publisher": "ProQuest",
        "publishedDate": "2009",
        "description": "Best practice guidelines for ADHD assessment include consideration of behavior rating scale data across multiple settings and informants (DuPaul & Stoner, 2003). Research suggests mean scores on common teacher rating scales vary significantly across ethnic groups (e.g. Epstein et al., 1998; Reid et al., 2000). Presence of ODD symptoms also influences teacher ratings of ADHD through the phenomenon labeled halo effects (e.g. Abikoff, et al., 1993). No studies have examined whether these two variables (ethnic group and halo effects of ODD) interact to influence accuracy in teacher-rated ADHD symptoms. Similarly, no investigations have examined halo effects across developmental levels. The present study expanded the literature on both ethnic influences and halo effects within teacher-rated ADHD symptoms, while extending these questions to an early childhood population. Teacher ratings of ADHD, direct observations of ADHD symptoms, and parent-reported ODD symptoms were collected in samples of preschool-aged (n = 108) and school-aged (n = 170) students. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the influence of oppositional behaviors on teacher-rated ADHD symptoms beyond that evidenced by directly observed ADHD symptoms. Results replicated the presence of halo effects within a school-aged sample, but found no evidence of halo effects in the preschool-aged group. Evidence of halo effects emerged in both Caucasian and ethnic minority groups and comparisons suggested teacher ratings of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in Caucasian students may be more vulnerable to halo effects as compared to ratings of ethnic minority students. Ethnic group differences were less consistent within comparisons of inattentive models. Possible explanations for these results, implications of the findings, and avenues for future research are discussed.",

Centuries before the Human-Covenant War would rage across the galaxy, a similar conflict erupted between the Prophets and the Elites—two alien races at odds over the sacred artifacts left by the powerful Forerunners, who disappeared eons ago. Although they would eventually form a stable alliance called the Covenant, there are those on both sides who question this fateful union. From an Elite splinter group rebelling against the Covenant during the time of its founding...to a brave Prophet caught in the machinations of the new leadership...to the root of the betrayal that would ultimately shatter the Covenant many years later, this is the untold chapter of the most unexpected heroes emerging from a realm filled with shocking treachery and ceaseless wonder.

        "description": "The original Halo: Evolutions, split into two volumes. This volume contains stories by: Tobias S. Buckell B. K. Evenson Jonathan Goff Eric Nylund Frank O'Connor Eric Raab When humanity expanded beyond the safety of Earth to new stars and horizons, they never dreamed what dangers they would encounter there. When the alien juggernaut known as the Covenant declared holy war upon the fragile human empire, millions of lives were lost—but, millions of heroes rose to the challenge. In such a far-reaching conflict, not many of the stories of these heroes, both human and alien, have a chance to become legend. This collection holds eleven stories that dive into the depths of the vast Halo universe, not only from the perspective of those who fought and died to save humanity, but also those who vowed to wipe humanity out of existence. Included in this volume you'll find the stories of: * A Spartan II washout who was most dangerous when he was told he could not serve with his fellow warriors. * An ONI intelligence officer who falls captive to a ravenous pack of Brutes * A dying man standing between The Covenant and the location of Earth, with only a compromised AI to aid him * The confession of an ODST who tried to get more out of the war than just victory * A select unit of Spartan IIIs put on a mission to succeed against against a never-before-seen Elite force * The impossible life and possible death of Admiral Preston J. Cole * And new to this volume, a glimpse into Forerunner life in \"Soma the Painter\" At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
